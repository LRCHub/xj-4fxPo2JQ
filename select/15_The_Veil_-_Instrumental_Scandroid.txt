A new world awaits for us beyond the veil

Far from our home
Destination unknown
Lonely the road
The path of the salvation code
We move alone
Forsake our home
Open highway
The city lights fading away

Feel like i'm separating
As i'm detonating
You keep me holding on when all my strenght have failed
As fear's replicating
Your words resonating
Reminding me that i will see a new world beyond the veil

Shadows of drones
Faces of clones
Caught in their dreams
Lost inside the datastream
Visions we chase
Truths that we faces
Curse of our kind
A lost horizon we can't find

Feel like i'm separating
As i'm detonating
You keep me holding on when all my strenght have failed
As fear's replicating
Your words resonating
Reminding me that i will see a new world beyond the veil

(A new world awaits for us beyond the veil)
(A new world awaits for us beyond the veil)

Mankind, machine
A future unseen
Beneath the veil
Electric eden's haven hails
Purpose combines
Future bloodlines
In waning daylight
A lost horizon in our sights

Feel like i'm separating
As i'm detonating
You keep me holding on when all my strenght have failed
As fear's replicating
Your words resonating
Reminding me that i will see a new world beyond the veil

(A new world awaits for us beyond the veil)
