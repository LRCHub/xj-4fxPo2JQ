Ten years ago on a cold dark night
There was someone killed 'neath the town hall light
Just a few at the scene and they all agree
That the man who ran looked a lot like me

Well the judge said, "Son, what is your alibi?
If you're somewhere else well you won't have to die"
And I said not a word though it meant my life
I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, Lord, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

Well the scaffold's high and eternity nears
And she stands in the crowd and sheds not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil she cries all over my bones

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, Lord, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

Nobody knows but me, yeah
